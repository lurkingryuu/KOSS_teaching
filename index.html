					<section data-auto-animate>
						<h1>Ownership model</h1>
						<p>Memory management can be done in ways other than Garbage collection or Manual memory management, like the Ownership model used in Rust</p>
					</section>
					<section data-auto-animate>
						<p>In this Model, there are some rules to be followed while programming, if not followed, will give compile time errors.</p>

						<h3>Ownership Rules</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Each value in Rust has a variable That's called it's owner</li>
